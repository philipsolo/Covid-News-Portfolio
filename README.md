# [Solomonidis.me](https://solomonidis.me) üåê

(Currently üèóÔ∏è as React implemented) First website I built to learn the full stack web development process. Started out as I was annoyed by the newsreaders I
found online containing adds and paywalls, wanted to customize my data intake as I pleased. The Covid-19 dashboard
was another requirement as no app I found had all the data in my customized preference.

## Notes üé∂

---

- To assist  the learning process I decided to break a core SWE principal and use different methods for duplicate
  functionality. I find that testing all possible scenarios is a good way of learning. For example as I wanted to find
  the optimal python SQL API (and revise mySQL) I used multiple different libraries and methods.


- Sentiment analysis performed on every news article is important not only as a quick warning of an articles potential
  bias but, as more and more articles are collected a 'scientific' conclusion can be made regarding the publisher.

## Build & Deployment üöÄ

---

### Local Run üíª

1. Clone The Repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/philipsolo/solomonidis-flask.git
    ```

2. If Mysql server is already installed simply dump the tables using the [data.sql](/db/data.sql) provided else use
   the [docker](docker-compose.yml) file provided
   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

3. Install dependencies and requirements.

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv myprojectenv
    ```

    ```bash
    source myprojectenv/bin/activate
    ```

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```


4. Each file in data_scraping folder retrieves different data, as an example for the all Covid-19 data run
   ```bash
   python data_scraping(legacy)/corona_db.py
   ```

5. Run the file
    ```bash
    python -m flask run
    ```

## GCP Run ‚òÅ

- Create [Cloud SQL](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/connect-app-engine-standard) and connect to App engine


- Enable and start [Google App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python3/runtime)


- The [app.yaml](app.yaml) Included contains the setup needed for Mysql to interface with Cloud Sql (Remember to give
  necessary **permissions** to app engine service account from IAM page)


- After installing [gcloud sdk](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install)
  simply run
  ```bash
  gcloud init
  ```
